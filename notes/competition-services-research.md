- Smaller social media
- FB and IG serve different purposes or are disconnected

[http://www.photogenerations.com/senior-pictures/](http://www.photogenerations.com/senior-pictures/)
- A very thorough website.  Really describes their business. But visually it is jumbled and difficult for someone new to find what they want.
